# New Relic Monitoring for .NET

You are viewing a previous version of the New Relic .NET agent repository. While the code here should be buildable, it may require some manual modifications or additional tooling in order to do so. This previous version is primarily for reference purposes.

## Support

New Relic hosts and moderates an online forum where customers can interact with New Relic employees as well as other customers to get help and share best practices. Like all official New Relic open source projects, there's a related Community topic in the New Relic Explorers Hub. You can find this project's topic/threads here:
